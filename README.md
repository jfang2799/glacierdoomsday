Glacier Doomsday 

Arrow Glacier is supposed to mark a significant change in GPU mining profitability. This site is being developed in order for miners to track the statistics of all cryptocurrency that affects the profitability of GPU mining. This web app will include the network hashrate of each cryptocurrency. It will also include the pool hashrate for the most commonly mined cryptocurrencies. 

All this information can hopefully help miners successfully track how COVID, chip shortages, and the Ethereum Arrow Glacier update will affect their profits and inform miners when is the best time to exit gracefully if they decide to do so.
